Extras & Tweaks
---------------

  • In version 1.9.4 I added an alternative set of overlay files for those who are having trouble with
    overlapping elements in the new overlay at resolutions lower than 1366 by 768.
    
    Said files can be found in "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision\resource\layout\Low Resolution Overlay\" along
    with a readme.

  • In version 1.8.2 I added an alternative menu file for those who wish to use a single 'Steam' menu.
    Said file can be found in "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision\resource\menus\Single Menu\" along with a readme.

  • In version 1.7 I've switched to using a centralised .ini file to handle Tweaks, something that X.nano
    came up with in his Apparition2 skin.
    
    All you have to do is open the file called 'settings.ini' found in "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision\", and
    follow the instructions provided within.

  Enjoy!



To Disable/Uninstall
--------------------

   Simply go back to the Interface tab in Steam's Settings and select a different skin.



Common Problems & Solutions
---------------------------

   Q: Why aren't the icons at the top of Steam properly aligned?
   A: The base skin is meant for the English version of Steam, if you're using a different language, you'll need
      to edit the file 'locale.ini' found in "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision\" and follow the instructions inside.

   Q: The Community's sub-links are overlapping my 'Console' tab, how can I fix that?
   A: The skin provides an alternative layout for the Community's sub-links. Insturctions can be found in the
      readme file located at "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision\resource\layout\Alternative Community\".

   Q: Did the fonts change in the last update?
   A: Unless specifically stated in the list of changes, no. However, whenever you update the skin, you're
      overwriting settings.ini, resetting all your tweaks in the process. If you were using Segoe UI instead
      of the default font, and/or one of the text size increases, you'll have to re-enable them.

   Q: Why am I not seeing text or content at all in Steam now?
   A: This is a bug that I've not been able to track down. Some people seem to end up with an 'empty' Steam after
      installing and activating the skin. This seems to be extremely rare however, and has been solved as simply
      as rebooting. If the problem persists, uninstall the skin and reinstall the skin from scratch.

   Q: Why am I not seeing any icons next to my games in the Library?
   A: The different views of the Library have different options for those, and this is a core feature of Steam,
      not directly related to this skin. In the Detailed view of the Library, it's selected from the gear icon
      above the game list's scrollbar on the left hand side. A small drop down menu will appear, tick 'Icons'.

   Q: Why doesn't the font in Steam look like the one in the previews?
   A: Make sure that DirectWrite is enabled (Steam > Settings > Interface) and that the font Segoe WP installed
      correctly (search for it in C:\Windows\Fonts).

   Q: Why is the option to enable DirectWrite greyed out for me?
   A: DirectWrite technology was first introduced with the release of Windows 7. It is available to Windows Vista
      users through the 'Platform Update for Windows Vista' (KB2117917) - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2117917,
      but unfortunately any older versions of Windows, including XP, are as of yet unable to benefit from it.

   Q: Is there anything Windows XP users could do to improve font smoothing?
   A: Windows XP users are recommended to switch to the SegoeUI font, which can be done from the 'settings.ini'
      file in "<Steam>\skins\PixelVision" (more on that file in the Tweaks section above).

   Q: When will this be available on OSX?
   A: I'm hoping to have that implemented 'soon'. But unfortunately I still don't have an ETA.

   Q: I'm still having trouble... Help?
   A: Feel free to contact me.
